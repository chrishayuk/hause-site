# Component synchronization — 25 September 2026

Both hause.design and chrishayuk.com consume HAUSE revision
`0fa7945173d2de34531b45309f0ece65cf93e5c3` on review branches.

The book now imports exhibition capabilities directly from the package. Its old
35-form compatibility snapshot is retired. StagedTransition and TextCorrection
have authored studies, reusable specimens, selection grammar and room links.
The catalogue, source API documentation and Ask corpus cover all 37 forms.
Historical evaluation inputs and outcomes retain their original release scope.

FigureMotion, AnchoredDisclosure, legibility and revision-continuity helpers now
belong to the library. The publication room demonstrates the reading helpers;
capability records and contribution relationships identify their actual origin.

`npm run check:hause` verifies 121 source files and the exact dependency pin.
The HAUSE source-parity workflow independently checks out that upstream commit,
so changing both a local component and its checksum still fails CI.
See the library's SYNC.md for the update procedure.

Validation: library tests and typecheck, both consumer test suites and production
builds, and the book's generated-page coverage checks. Browser interaction and
visual comparison are not part of these source/build checks. These review
branches have not been deployed.

The shared publication library now supplies Codex, FolioObject, Marginalia,
NotebookEdition, NotebookSupport and ReadingFigure. The publication room has a
working codex specimen. Chris Hay opts the Repairer entry into seven composed
spreads, with direct manuscript and recorded-history views. Other entries and
preserved editions retain their existing presentation.

Directional leaf turns now replace the spread fade. Codex owns fragment navigation
inside its pages to prevent competing scroll handlers. The shared Manuscript form
provides continuous long-form prose and chapter navigation separately from folios.

EditorialPlate supplies wide, inset and portrait image compositions. Both sites
demonstrate it with their existing, explicitly attributed visual studies.

The Codex binding now keeps a fixed responsive height across folios. Longer
spreads scroll internally, with reserved scrollbar space and a stable pagination
row. Page-turn snapshots preserve the visible scroll position. Read and print
retain their continuous full-content layout.
